## Advanced Health Analytics Demonstrations

### 1. Comprehensive Health Risk Assessment
```sql
-- Professional-grade health risk categorization with BMI and blood pressure analysis
SELECT 
    u.name,
    h.bmi,
    CASE 
        WHEN h.bmi < 18.5 THEN 'Underweight'
        WHEN h.bmi BETWEEN 18.5 AND 24.9 THEN 'Normal'
        WHEN h.bmi BETWEEN 25.0 AND 29.9 THEN 'Overweight'
        ELSE 'Obese'
    END AS health_category,
    h.systolic_bp,
    h.diastolic_bp
FROM Users u
JOIN Health_Metrics h ON u.user_id = h.user_id;
```

### 2. Realistic Activity Pattern Analysis
```sql
-- Authentic lifestyle insights with natural variations and progression tracking
SELECT 
    u.name,
    ROUND(AVG(d.steps), 0) AS avg_daily_steps,
    ROUND(STDDEV(d.steps), 0) AS natural_variation,
    COUNT(DISTINCT d.activity_date) AS active_days,
    ROUND(AVG(d.workout_minutes), 1) AS avg_exercise_duration
FROM Users u
JOIN Daily_Activity_Log d ON u.user_id = d.user_id
GROUP BY u.user_id, u.name
ORDER BY avg_daily_steps DESC;
```

### 3. Nutritional Intelligence Dashboard
```sql
-- Advanced nutrition analysis with macronutrient ratios and dietary quality assessment
SELECT 
    u.name,
    AVG(m.calories) AS avg_daily_calories,
    AVG(m.protein_g) AS avg_protein,
    AVG(m.carbs_g) AS avg_carbs,
    AVG(m.fat_g) AS avg_fat,
    ROUND(AVG(m.protein_g) * 4 / AVG(m.calories) * 100, 1) AS protein_ratio_pct
FROM Users u
JOIN Meal_Log m ON u.user_id = m.user_id
GROUP BY u.user_id, u.name;
```

All queries tested and written specifically for Oracle SQL.
